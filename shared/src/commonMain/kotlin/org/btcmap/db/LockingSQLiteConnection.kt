/**
 * Serializes every statement executed on a [SQLiteConnection].
 *
 * The app shares one connection between the UI's reads and the background sync,
 * seed and session writers, all of which run on the multi-threaded
 * [kotlinx.coroutines.ioDispatcher]. Android renders query results into a
 * [android.database.CursorWindow] that is refilled lazily as the cursor
 * advances; a write committed on another thread between two refills changes the
 * window's row count underneath the cursor, so the next `step()`/`get*()`
 * throws
 * `IllegalStateException: Couldn't read row N, col M from CursorWindow`.
 *
 * Holding [lock] for the whole lifetime of a prepared statement (from [prepare]
 * until the statement is closed) guarantees a read cursor can never be
 * interleaved with a concurrent write. The lock is reentrant, so a statement
 * prepared inside [transaction] (or any nested statement) does not deadlock.
 *
 * The same lock also makes the app correct on drivers whose connections are not
 * thread-safe at all, e.g. `BundledSQLiteDriver`, which is what the unit tests
 * use.
